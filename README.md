# Feedback-control-system-for-rubber-plates-made-of-recycled-waste-tires.
This project consists of two parts. The first part: Making rubber plate from recycled
tires. The second part: involves the feedback mechanism in two systems of the
prototype, a hard-based part of a wooden stage, the other part: a software system
that reads the distance using an ultrasonic sensor and so deflection 
can be calculated through the formula: “distance before exerting force - distance after exerting force”.
The file of the code shows the code that was used to measure the distance. 
According to this distance we were able to tell if the recycled tires were good
or needed to be remade.
